### Introduction

[Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (187)](http://truebluemigration.com/visa-types/employer-sponsored-visas/rsms-187-visa-/)

If you want to sponsor employees on this permanent residency visa, the employer must be based in a designated regional area. The nominated occupation must be on the MLTSSL or the Regional Occupation list (ROL). The nominee must have at least three years of full-time work experience, as well as meeting the skill level requirement of the occupation. Some occupation requires a skill assessment.
