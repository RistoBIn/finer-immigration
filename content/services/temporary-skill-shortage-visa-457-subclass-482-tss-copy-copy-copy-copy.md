**TRIBUNALS**

### AAT – Migration Division

The Refugee Review Tribunal and Migration Review Tribunal have now become a part of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The AAT is responsible for providing an independent review process for visa refusals and cancellation decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.

We strongly recommend that you have a migration lawyer represent you at your AAT hearing. WLW Migration Lawyers are experts in this appeal process and can help prepare your case and advocate for you at your hearing.

### IAA – Immigration Assessment Authority

The IAA is a new tribunal set up as a part of the fast track assessment process. The IAA will provide a limited review of fast track reviewable decisions. While in many cases a hearing will not be provided, we strongly recommend you obtain advice about how to prepare your appeal. With short time-frames involved, it is important to contact us as soon as possible after learning your case has been referred to the IAA.
